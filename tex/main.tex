            \textbf{Abstract}: \\
            Economists have been predicting the end of linear growth for some time. Further development towards a circular economy is the next big goal, as it offers new growth potential. And nature is an excellent role model in this regard because it knows no waste. For Festo, integrating biology as a basis for ongoing development in automation is particularly promising. It can be used to transform a biological cell into the smallest factory of the future.

            To do this, we need to understand the biological processes and create optimal conditions to grow or manipulate different organisms. By using AI and quantum sensors to analyze the state of growth, we can then control and optimally monitor various parameters.
            
            The aim of our work in this area is to create solutions that are real alternatives to today’s established chemical processes, which often require a lot of heat and pressure and are mostly based on fossil raw materials.
            
             Using the example of photobioreactors for the production of algae and the conversion of hydrogen into alternative energy sources, Festo shows how automation can contribute to a significant increase in efficiency in the future and thus to sustainable business.

            \textbf{Abstract}: \\
            Cyber physical energy system (CPES) is where information and energy merges together to improve the overall system performance including economic, comfort, and safety aspects. Artificial intelligence which are enabled by internet of things (IoT), big data, and cloud computing, has a big role in the optimization of CPES. 
            
            In this talk, we focus on event-based reinforcement learning (eRL) which makes decisions according to events instead of states. 
            This method provides a scalable solution for large-scale multi-stage decision making problem in which an accurate model may not be available. The performance of this method will be demonstrated by examples in smart buildings, smart micro-grid of buildings, and smart cities, and in particular on the problem of stochastic matching between the renewable power generation and the uncertain charging demand from the plug-in electric vehicles (PHEVs) in a city. 
            
            We will also discuss extensions of this method to distributed optimization. We hope this work sheds light to the optimization of CPES.

            \textbf{Abstract}: \\
            Deployment of robots in human-inhabited environments requires allowing robots to react rapidly, robustly and safely to changes in the environment. Recent advances in machine learning to analyze and model a variety of data offer powerful solutions for real-time control. For these techniques to be efficiently deployed and endorsed, they must be accompanied with explicit guarantees on the learned model.
            
            This talk will give an overview of a variety of methods to endow robots with the necessary reactivity to adapt their path at time-critical situations. The learned control laws are accompanied by theoretical guarantees for stability and boundedness. Paucity of data is a reality in many robotics tasks. 
            
            I will present methods by which robots can learn control laws from only a handful of examples, while generalizing to the entire state space. I will present a variety of applications, from dynamic manipulation in interaction with humans to reactive navigation in crowded pedestrian environments.

            \large \textit{Sunday, September 1st , 2024} \\ \\
            \textbf{Abstract}: \\
            Resilience, understood as the ability of a network to carry out ist goals under adversarial attacks and unexpected failures, is critical for autonomy. Despite important advances in the design of distributed coordination and decision-making algorithms, multi-agent networks have proven fragile to targeted attacks. Novel theories and tools are therefore needed to guarantee resiliency of these systems, being the development of notions and techniques that characterize network critical resilience. 
            
            However, obtaining such characterizations is difficult as resilience and performance are a complex function of the network’s and adversary’s capabilities, knowledge, resources, and the network interconnection structure. At the same time, we also need novel design methodologies that can protect multi-agent networks and adaptively manage their interconnection over time to achieve performance guarantees.  
            
            In this talk, we present our recent progress in these directions including algorithmic methods for metric computation, data-driven algorithms for multi-agent learning, and defense strategies.

            Automation 5.0 represents the cutting-edge evolution of automation technologies within the framework of Industry 5.0, a revolution that further integrates humans into the automation chain. Central to the success of Automation 5.0 is the acceptance and trust of robots by humans. The social acceptance concept, defined as “an individual’s psychological state with regard to his or her voluntary or intended use of a particular technology” is crucial in Automation 5.0 for seamless robots’ integration into various domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation. Trust is another fundamental aspect of the HRC in Automation 5.0, enabling humans to rely on robots to perform tasks safely, accurately, and efficiently. Humans should feel confident that robots will operate within defined parameters and respond appropriately to unexpected situations. The aim of this workshop is to bridge roboticists from academia and industry to exchange insights and perspectives on fostering acceptance and trust of robots in Automation 5.0. In the discussion, particular attention will be devoted to the measurement of the key factors influencing human acceptance of robots in industrial settings, i.e., perceived occupational safety, physical ergonomics, cognitive ergonomics, efficiency, design, and privacy. In fact, certain metrics for these factors have already been established in existing literature, while others necessitate additional efforts for quantification and integration into robot design and control. Therefore, the perspectives of experts in this field will be presented aiming at delineating the path for the definition of appropriate functional and non-functional requirements for robots’ acceptance to be integrated into their architecture and design.

            This workshop delves into the contemporary challenges of autonomous multi-vehicle systems, particularly focusing on formation control and collision avoidance for multi-agent configurations in the context of Smart Cities and Industry 5.0. The increasing attention to these issues arises from the successful deployment of Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) in Industry 5.0 and Intelligent Transportation Systems. Designing fully autonomous vehicle systems requires addressing key requirements such as precise signal tracking, goal attainment for each vehicle, coordination through formation control tools, and ensuring collision avoidance. However, existing approaches often lack efficiency when overlooking physical limitations in vehicle modelling, compromising their effectiveness in scenarios where geometrical constraints and saturation effects are crucial. The workshop aims to analyze recent advancements in constrained control for multi-vehicle systems, exploring how traditional constrained control techniques and data-driven approaches can be employed independently or in tandem to devise innovative and efficient hybrid control architectures for autonomous multi-vehicle systems moving in shared environments.

            The greatest difficulty in implementing RECs is related to connecting the multidisciplinary nature of all the social elements with technological perspectives. These characteristics put in evidence the opportunity, presented by RECs, aimed at defining economic, social, and technical policies to determine changes in a macro sector by acting at a local level. The technical impact of a single REC makes the overall system globally smart while however each local community retain its independence. The starting point of any technical approaches for the construction of RECs must necessarily be linked to the characterization of the reference area, studying the possibility of creating independent or autonomous realities exploiting the territorial resources. The technological development must exploit all possible elements of a REC and all possible optimization and control architectures. The plant technology and energy conversion system must be characterized, on the basis of the available resource. Therefore, the impact of new technologies of RECs in the energy sector is indispensable since it is possible to reduce emissions and reach technological development and to solve energy congestion through incentives and the promotion of energy policies. RECs are also implementable in low energy efficiency contexts. Promoting innovative and replicable models of local and rural community management through hi-tech tools, new collaborations with local authorities and institutions is, therefore, necessary to step forward to a carbon-free society.

            The ultimate aspiration of collaborative robotics is to bring robots to a level where they can interact with people in a manner that mirrors human-human interaction. This involves establishing a paradigm of shared autonomy, where robots neither function independently nor act subserviently to humans. Instead, they actively collaborate with human operators and coexist seamlessly, complementing each other’s strengths and capabilities to achieve common goals.  In this shared autonomy framework, when humans can actively participate in robots’ decisional processes and understand the causal relationships of actions, they are more likely to trust robots’ autonomous behaviors and collaborate effectively. In turn, when robots leverage shared abstraction models of human reasoning and the context they are operating in, they can better adapt and act proactively to achieve complex objectives. As humans understand robots’ actions, they can also provide feedback to refine the shared abstraction models, promoting continuous adaptation and improvement of the collaboration process. Establishing this interconnection is key to building a trustworthy collaboration and unlocking the full potential of human-robot synergy. This workshop aims to bring together different expertise and perspectives in designing, deploying, and evaluating shared autonomy and transparent collaboration to create a common ground for efficient and safe human-robot collaboration.

            Regularly lifting heavy loads is considered one of the main factors contributing to work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Industrial exoskeletons have recently seen great developments, with dozens of devices literally invading the market. Robotic exoskeletons have the potential to protect the musculoskeletal system from injury and to reduce the occurrence of chronic musculoskeletal disorders. At the same time, we can observe that the adoption rate is still rather low, suggesting that despite the potential of occupational exoskeletons, there is still room for improvement.  This workshop can be seen as a crossing point between the views of industry and academia in the development of exoskeleton technologies. The main objective of this workshop is to make academia aware of market demands and requirements and to make the industry aware of existing solutions and research opportunities. The workshop also includes live demonstrations from both industrial and academic sides, with the main objective of soliciting discussions.

            The current utilization of multi-robot system (MRS) in industry and logistics has delineated a clear demarcation between tasks performed by humans and those by robots, often lacking efficient collaboration and adaptability. Despite their ability to perform numerous tasks, MRS are not sufficiently flexible, particularly in resilient and adaptive operations, which are crucial for dynamic industrial environments. As technology advances, the potential of MRS expands, yet the complexity and challenges within these systems also escalate. This underscores the need for a transformative approach in how these systems are integrated and managed to enhance not only their functionality but also their interaction within human-centric environments. One of the foremost challenges lies in developing systems that are not only resilient, adaptive, dynamic, and scalable but are also designed to transition from human support to automation in a modular fashion as technology and algorithms advance. This modular transition is designed to facilitate a seamless switch between robot and human operation. This includes using teleoperation as a method to bridge the gap when a situation demands human intervention or insight. The system should be equipped with decision-making capabilities to autonomously determine when it requires human assistance, depending on the complexity or unpredictability of the task at hand. Additionally, the system can learn from these human-led interventions, gradually incorporating human strategies and solutions into its algorithms to enhance future autonomous operations, thereby improving adaptability and resilience in dynamic environments. During the workshop, we will explore the potential to construct such systems through a smart orchestrating architecture. This architecture leverages various services in a modular manner, enhancing the flexibility of MRS and fostering a symbiotic relationship with human operators.

            Robotics research has drawn much inspiration from humans as a system: in the design of the anthropomorphic aspects of manipulators, sensors, and actuators, approaches for coordinating full body motions, and the higher-level strategies for realizing complex tasks and interacting with the external environment and other humans. Today, robotics as a field has matured to the point where methodologies developed and used in robotics may be leveraged to address research questions in many other fields, ranging from neuroscience to computer animation. Together with the tools from biomechanics, robotics enables our efforts to explore natural human motion, leading to improvements in treatments for patients with neuro-musculoskeletal disorders, and facilitating development of human inspired robots. In recent years, expectations for remotely controlled robots have increased. Progress is being made in the development of technology that allows humans to perform tasks that were previously difficult to be done manually using remote-controlled robots. There are also high expectations for the use of remote-control technology for robots operating in various environments such as underwater and space. Interface technology for remote control using 5th generation mobile communication systems is attracting attention. The main objectives of the proposed TC are: 1)Achieving natural human behavior in remote operations and enabling more sophisticated strategies in complex tasks and interaction with the external environment; 2)Estimating and predicting human movement status and promoting applications in rehabilitation, prosthetic limbs, and exoskeleton design; and 3) Development of strategies to reconstruct human behavior on artificial anthropomorphic systems.

            This workshop on Machine Learning for Automation (MLA) provides a unique opportunity to explore the cutting edge research and practice on how machine learning is transforming automation, and vice versa. How is ML transforming semiconductor manufacturing? Accelerating the design of next-generation batteries? Making buildings smarter? Achieving safe, green, and inclusive mobility in cities? Evolving automatic virtual metrology? And how to advance fundamental theories and algorithms in MLA practice, such as solving mixed-binary linear programming problems, combining constrained programming and satisfiability solvers, improving data efficiency and robustness, and making AI models explainable? What are the options in commercial software such as Matlab and Simulink for MLA? We provide 10 exciting talks from leading experts to address these questions. Beyond that, a poster session, a demo session, and a panel session would provide great hands-on experience and opportunities to interact with the experts in MLA. This will be a memorable full day workshop for the participants. This workshop is organized by the IEEE RAS TC on MLA, with support from TC on Logistics, TC on Semiconductor Manufacturing, TC on Smart Buildings, and TC on Digital Manufacturing and Human Machine Interaction.

            The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) has been developing standards since 2011 to formally adopt and confirm best practices in robotics and automation as standards. Its main objectives are to promote: common measures and definitions in robotics and automation; measurability and comparability of robotics and automation technology; integrity, portability, and reusability of robotics and automation technology.
            The talk will start to briefly introduce the IEEE Standards Association process to develop standards, and presents well-known success stories.
            The second part of the talk is dedicated to the past, present, and future of the IEEE RAS standards activities. Ranging from the first ever ontological standard for robotics and automation (2015) covering core concepts in this domain, to the most recent on Robot Task Representation (2024), encompassing standards for Map Data Representation and Autonomous Robotics. Current and future efforts will also be introduced in the areas of Human Robot Interaction, Multiple Robots, and Humanoid Robots. \\ \\

The short course will present some approaches for collision detection and avoidance at intersections. Two new proposed strategies will be present: i) one based on Artificial Intelligence tools and traffic simulation; ii) second based on decentralized algorithms, geometric characterization of the intersection and distributed optimization procedures.

Furthermore, the reward shaping is both critical and time consuming. In this talk, these problems are illustrated, and a couple of simple and efficient strategies are proposed. The strategies are applied to energy optimization of moving devices, including eco-driving of electric cars and trucks. It is also shown how constraint programming (CP) combined with a satisfiability (SAT) solver can be used for planning, based on Petri nets. Optimal plans can then be generated 100-1000 times faster compared to standard strategies.

Most existing studies on vehicle group formation neither propose a standard vehicle group model, nor consider vehicle mobility and dynamic topology of vehicle groups. Instead, they focus on detecting dynamic evolution without predicting it. This talk presents the dynamic formation, cooperation, evolution and prediction for autonomous vehicle groups, thus benefiting the effective operation of smart cities.

[\section{Discover Bari}]
Bari is the capital city of Apulia Region (or Puglia, as it is known to the locals). While keeping strong ties with its own traditions, it represents a modern city, as well an important economic center, in the whole Southern Italy. Bari is a highly multifaceted city, and you really need to discover every single aspect to understand its true core. \\
Known as the \textit{Gateway to the East} due to its long tradition of trade, this capital of Apulia is rich in history. Exploring the historic city center allows us to discover its most authentic character, with signs of its past scattered through the local alleyways and endless examples of age-old traditions passed from generation to generation. Then, the famous Bari promenade offers one of the most beautiful view in Italy, overlooking the clear sea and the unique charm of Bari. \\
Bari is composed of four urban sections. In the northern city area, there is the Old Town (also called \textit{Bari Vecchia}) between two modern harbours, with the \textit{Basilica of San Nicola} (Saint Nicolaus), the \textit{Cathedral of San Sabino}, and the \textit{Hohenstaufen Castle of Frederick II}, which is now also a major nightlife district. In the southern district, the \textit{Murat quarter} (erected by Joachim Murat), the modern heart of the city, is laid out on a rectangular grid-plan with a promenade on the sea and the major shopping district. \\
Today, this dynamic city, nestled in the heart of the countryside, punctuated by white dry-stone walls, still holds dear the memory of its seafaring exploits of the Middle Ages, as well as its precious monuments and striking churches.

\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{multicols}{2}
[\subsection*{Puglia’s Gastronomy}]
The region’s cuisine is based on typical products found within the surrounding region of Apulia: \textit{wheat}, \textit{olive oil}, \textit{seafood} and \textit{wine}. Local flour is used in homemade bread and pasta production including, most notably, the famous \textit{orecchiette} ear-shaped pasta. \\
Homemade dough and olive oils are also used to bake fried \textit{panzerotti} with mozzarella, and \textit{focaccia alla barese} with tomatoes. Perhaps, Bari’s most famous dish is the oven-baked \textit{Patate, riso e cozze} (potatoes with rices and mussels). The whole Apulian region have a range of wines, including the classical \textit{Primitivo}, \textit{Castel del Monte}, \textit{Muscat}, and several \textit{rosé wines}. \\
While attending the conference, take some time to explore the region's rich culinary heritage. Known for its delicious seafood dishes and traditional Pugliese cuisine, Bari offers a gastronomic experience like no other. Be sure to visit local trattorias and osterias to experience the region's authentic flavors. \\
The Baresi are also very fond of vegetables, especially \textit{chicory} and \textit{fava beans} they combine in a wonderful hearty dish. We also recommend a pasta dish unique to the region --\textit{spaghetti all’assassina}--, which is dried pasta cooked only in a heady sauce of tomato and wine and then topped with cool ricotta. The pasta stays firm, much more so than mere al dente, and has a delightful chewiness to it. The “assassin” reference is to the chili peppers that make this a fiery killer of a dish, said to be created in Bari in the 1970s.

Its strategic position and its fertile soil made it an attractive proposition. In the 8th century BC, it became a Greek colony and was part of Magna Graecia. \textit{Taranto} was one of the most flourishing cities during this period. In 272 BC, the Romans conquered the region, leaving behind a wealth of archaeological sites. In the Middle Ages, Puglia was ruled by \textit{Goths}, \textit{Lombards}, \textit{Arabs}, \textit{Normans}, and \textit{Byzantines}, each leaving their mark on the region’s culture and architecture.
