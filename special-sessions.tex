In the current era of intense global competition and rapid technological advances, manufacturers must frequently introduce new product variants. Each change in the product family requires the adaptation of manufacturing systems, and the frequent reconfiguration of production lines leads to sustainability challenges. Production resources are prematurely taken out of service, leading to scrapping or, at best, being sold for spare parts.  In response to these challenges, the concepts of Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 have been introduced. Industry 4.0 represents significant improvements in production efficiency and flexibility through digitization and AI-driven technologies. Industry 5.0 takes these technological advances further, and it focuses on three fundamental principles: sustainability, human-centricity, and resilience. By emphasizing these pillars, Industry 5.0 seeks to address the environmental impact of manufacturing processes, improve the well-being of workers, and fortify systems against unforeseen disruptions. Despite its promising potential, the exploration of Industry 5.0 is still in its early stages, with limited research and a lack of systematic understanding. In this context, this session welcomes original theoretical approaches and new applications that improve sustainability, resilience, and human centricity during the design, maintenance, operation, and decommissioning of assembly lines.

Semiconductor manufacturing is one of the most complex manufacturing processes. Due to the increased use of new technologies, the global economy is significantly impacted by the semiconductor industry. Competition in the semiconductor sector is fierce. As a result, the semiconductor industry needs to continually reinvent itself and be resourceful at all decision levels. Efficient design, analysis, and operation of semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and corresponding supply chains are essential.  - Various factors can disrupt certain chains of the production networks. For example, the global supply chain has been disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic which spreads around the world, resulting, for instance, in chip shortage. All this has an impact on the production (product quality, supply, etc.). Subsequently, effective decisions must be taken to conduct production operations at different levels of the supply chain links while addressing disruptions. -To ensure reliable results and reduced operational costs, highly automated manufacturing systems are used to carry out operations and make millions of decisions per day. This requires planning and scheduling methods in manufacturing execution systems (MES) and in logistics/supply chain management tools to support their automated operation. As new trends such as sustainable production, cloud computing, and Industry 4.0 emerge, they also need to be addressed. -The development and application of planning and scheduling methods for these high-cost systems and supply-chains are critical elements in improving their operations.
